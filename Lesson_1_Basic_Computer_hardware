#What is a computer

To put it simply a computer is a motherboard that has had different accessories connected to it so that it can perform a predetermined function. Computers come in all shapes and sizes, though you are probably only used to thinking of laptops and desktops as computers. When in truth a lot of the machines you see and use everyday are/have computers built in. Your phone, console, tablet and etc are computers, the stoplight that decides which car lanes stop and move are controlled by computers. The list just goes on and on but at their core they can be simplified to being a motherboard with a CPU attached to it, with other parts connected as needed to provide functionality. 

#Parts that make up a normal computer (LAPTOP/DESKTOP)
Motherboard
>board of circuits responsible for connecting together the different parts

CMOS
>battery to give just enough power for storage of things like time


ROM chip
>read only memory
>chip that has the BIOS installed on it

NIC
>Network Interface Card
>Allows a motherboard to interface with the different Internet Protocols

Video Graphics Card
>Processes visual information
>Sends visual representation of information decided by the motherboard to the connected device
>Normally will be what shows you the desktop  and whatnot


Hard drive
>device responsible for handling most of the storage 
>will normally have an OS installed that will efficiently manage everything


RAM
>random access memory
>secondary set of memory thats quicker and easier to access and use in comparison to the hard drive but it smaller and temporary


Fan
>cools down all the connected devices/peripherals 


Power brick
>device responsible for providing power in a format easily usable by the motherboard and its connected devices


CPU
>central processing unit
>responsible for processing the information


#Laptops/Desktops 

Laptops and desktops which are the most commonly known computers are composed of a motherboard that has a CPU (Central Processing Unit) for well processing information, calculating things. A Network Interface card is attached so they can communicate across the wire. It also has a video graphics card attached so that it can output information to a screen. There are a couple buses(interfaces) set up so that you can connect devices like a mouse, keyboard and headphones for interaction with the motherboard (for things like sending/receiving information ). Next they have a hard drive for storage though normally an operating system will be installed onto it allowing for more efficient management of the storage, Also RAM random access memory is attached to allow for a more flexible, fast and easily accessed memory for temporary storage. Lastly there is a BIOS (basic input and output system) which is installed on the motherboard to manage all of the connected hardware and ensure they can interact with each other (it is installed on a ROM (read only memory) chip located on the motherboard).
